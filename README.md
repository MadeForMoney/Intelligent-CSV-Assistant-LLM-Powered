# Intelligent-CSV-Assistant-LLM-Powered
Built a web-based tool where users can upload CSV files and chat with a Gemini LLM to analyze the data. Used Python's SmartDataFrame for context-aware data insights and Streamlit for the UI. The system can explain column usage, detect NaN values, list unique entries, and answer user queries interactively.
